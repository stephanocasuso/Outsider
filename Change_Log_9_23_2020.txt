Simons_Block Prefab has been created and scripted. Is capable of woring with any door or wall, provided you choose
the object in the Unity's inspector. It's main script is GameController, but its parts use ButtonB and Door_Controller.

Simons_Blocks is composed of 4 black cube that each have a colored point light ajacent to their surface.
Each light has a animation that will flash its color aganist the block, giving the "button" a glow.
In the center is the white cube that allows for doors to be moved. This will activate when he puzle has been solved twice
and the block has been shot after winning twice.

Simons_Blocks has been designed to use the LeanTween's sound assest to make the designated beeps.
This can be altered, provided you have the sound files in the same folders as the project and write the correct code for them.

Further details for how the scripts work can be found as comments inside of the script.
Details for how the animation and "buttons" are set up can be found either as photos and videos in the discord channel
or you can ask me , Ledarrius, personally.
